# Problem Solving Steps

1. Understanding the problem
2. Concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve or Simplify
5. Look back and refactor

## Understanding the problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words ?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem ?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem ?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs to solve the problem ?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem


## Concreate examples

1. Start with simple Examples.
2. Progress to more complex examples.
3. Explore examples with empty inputs.
4. Explore examples with invalid inputs.


## Break it down
