# Space Complexity
Space complexity can involve the space taken up by the inputs to the algorithm. What we reallu refer in coding interviews and when measuring algorithms is `auxiliary space complexity`

#### Auxiliay space complexity
Space required by the algorithm, not inluding the space taken up by the inputs.

### Rules of thumb
* Most primitives (booleans,numbers,undefined,null) data types are constant space
* String require O(n) where n is string length
* Reference types(arrays,objects,map,set) are O(n),where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys(objects)
