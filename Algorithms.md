# Space Complexity
Space complexity can involve the space taken up by the inputs to the algorithm. What we reallu refer in coding interviews and when measuring algorithms is `auxiliary space complexity`

#### Auxiliay space complexity
Space required by the algorithm, not inluding the space taken up by the inputs.
