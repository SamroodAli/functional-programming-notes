# Functional programming Notes

Since functional programming is not all about the function keyword, I will use `function` for procedures and `Functions` for real functions.

```js
function procedure(x,y){
  console.log( x+ y)
}
```

* a function that calls a procedure is not a Function
* a function without a `return` keyword is not a Function.
* a Function can take many inputs to return many outputs

```math
f(x)= 2x^2 + 3
```
